# OpenClaude Descriptor Migration — Progress Tracker

**Master Plan**: [`plan/cheeky-cooking-moon.md`](./cheeky-cooking-moon.md)
**Current Phase**: Phase 3E — Descriptor-Native Onboarding Closure
**Next Planned Phase**: None — Phase 3E closure and related docs cleanup landed on branch
**Goal**: Establish the descriptor system without regressing current behavior. Get all metadata into one place before deeper runtime migration starts.
**Last Updated**: 2026-04-26 00:10

---

## Phase 1 Exit Criteria

- [x] Registry exists and loads
- [x] Every currently supported integration has descriptor coverage
- [x] Preset defaults and `/usage` can read from descriptors
- [x] Existing saved profiles still deserialize and activate

### Post-Main-Merge Drift Review

- [x] Reconciled upstream Z.AI provider support into the descriptor framework after merging `main`
- [x] Removed the standalone Z.AI URL/model helper path from active code
- [x] Moved Z.AI thinking/context/output metadata into the Z.AI route catalog
- [x] Kept Z.AI shim behavior descriptor-backed through runtime route metadata
- [x] Verified descriptor-backed labels and provider flag defaults after the merge

---

## Phase 1A: Registry Skeleton

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Create `src/integrations/descriptors.ts` — all core types from master plan section "Core Descriptor Types"
- [x] Create `src/integrations/define.ts` — `defineVendor`, `defineGateway`, `defineAnthropicProxy`, `defineBrand`, `defineModel`, `defineCatalog`
- [x] Create `src/integrations/registry.ts` — Maps, register/get/list APIs, catalog helpers, `validateIntegrationRegistry`
- [x] Create `src/integrations/index.ts` — loader entrypoint that imports and registers all descriptor modules
- [x] Create `src/integrations/compatibility.ts` — `PRESET_VENDOR_MAP`, `vendorIdForPreset`, `gatewayIdForPreset`, `routeForPreset`
- [x] Create `src/integrations/registry.test.ts` — register/retrieve, duplicate ids, missing refs, transport validation, usage delegates, enrichment
- [x] Run registry tests — all pass (23/23)
- [x] Run `tsc --noEmit` on new files — zero errors in `src/integrations/`

---

## Phase 1B: Descriptor Inventory for Vendors and Gateways

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

### Vendors (first-party and direct)
- [x] `src/integrations/vendors/anthropic.ts` — native, usage supported
- [x] `src/integrations/vendors/openai.ts` — openai-compatible, static/hybrid catalog

- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/dashscope-intl.ts` — hosted
- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/nvidia-nim.ts` — hosted
- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/custom.ts` — hosted, empty static catalog
- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/kimi-code.ts` — hosted (additional preset not in master inventory)

### Special-case surfaces (document unresolved nuances inline)
- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/github.ts` — special native-Claude path
- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/bedrock.ts` — bedrock transport
- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/vertex.ts` — vertex transport
- [x] `src/integrations/gateways/mistral.ts` — dedicated runtime, not generic openai-compatible

### Verification
- [x] Cross-check migration inventory table — every preset has a descriptor file
- [x] `validateIntegrationRegistry()` returns zero errors
- [x] Every route has `transportConfig.kind` assigned
- [x] Every gateway/direct vendor has catalog strategy declared

---

## Phase 1C: Shared Brand and Model Index Seeding

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

### Brand descriptors
- [x] `src/integrations/brands/claude.ts`
- [x] `src/integrations/brands/gpt.ts`
- [x] `src/integrations/brands/kimi.ts`
- [x] `src/integrations/brands/deepseek.ts`
- [x] `src/integrations/brands/llama.ts`
- [x] `src/integrations/brands/qwen.ts`

### Shared model index
- [x] `src/integrations/models/claude.ts` — sonnet, opus, haiku variants
- [x] `src/integrations/models/gpt.ts` — gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.
- [x] `src/integrations/models/kimi.ts`
- [x] `src/integrations/models/deepseek.ts` — chat + reasoner variants
- [x] `src/integrations/models/llama.ts`
- [x] `src/integrations/models/qwen.ts`

### Documentation
- [x] Inline comments note fallback to `openaiContextWindows.ts`
- [x] Inline comments note gateway onboarding does not require editing model index files

---

## Phase 1D: Config and Preset Compatibility

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Widen `Providers` from closed union to `string` in `src/utils/config.ts`
- [x] Stop normalizing unknown stored providers back to `'openai'` in `src/utils/providerProfiles.ts`
- [x] Add `resolveProfileRoute(provider)` helper returning `{ vendorId, gatewayId?, routeId }`
- [x] Update `applyProviderProfileToProcessEnv()` to use route-resolution helper with explicit fallback
- [x] Preserve Bedrock/Vertex/GitHub runtime exceptions during descriptor-backed profile activation
- [x] Serialize descriptor-backed startup fallback using legacy-compatible startup kinds so saved profiles still reload
- [x] All `providerProfiles.test.ts` pass (43/43)

---

## Phase 1E: CLI Flag and Usage Surface Migration

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Derive valid provider names from descriptors/compatibility in `src/utils/providerFlag.ts`
- [x] Preserve `--provider ollama`, `--provider minimax` semantics
- [x] Implement `getUsageDescriptor(activeId)` in `src/commands/usage/index.ts`
- [x] Anthropic usage supported, MiniMax preserved, unsupported shows neutral fallback
- [x] Add usage routing tests — supported, unsupported, gateway delegation

---

## Phase 1F: Phase-1 Verification and Merge Pass

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Registry unit and validation tests pass
- [x] Compatibility mapping tests — every preset has valid descriptor mapping
- [x] Saved-profile compatibility tests — old profiles deserialize, unknown providers preserved
- [x] Run `src/utils/*provider*.test.ts` — all green
- [x] Run `src/utils/model/*.test.ts` — all green
- [x] Run profile startup/env tests — all green
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` across project — waived as pre-existing repo debt outside this branch's scope
- [x] Cross-check: no provider from migration inventory is missing a descriptor file

Notes:
- Re-ran targeted Phase 1E/1F verification on 2026-04-25 after the latest compatibility/usage/provider changes, including loader/registry sanity coverage; all targeted suites are green.
- Filtered `bun run typecheck` output for the Phase 1 files changed in this branch is now clean.
- Repo-wide `bun run typecheck` is still red in unrelated existing areas such as `src/__tests__/providerCounts.test.ts`, `src/assistant/sessionHistory.ts`, `src/bootstrap/state.ts`, and multiple `src/bridge/` and `src/cli/` files; that baseline issue is not a new Phase 1 blocker introduced by this branch.
- Full review follow-up on 2026-04-25 20:01 fixed skipped provider-surface updates in `src/utils/status.tsx`, `src/utils/swarm/teammateModel.ts`, `src/utils/model/configs.ts`, and `src/utils/model/deprecation.ts`, with new focused tests in `src/utils/status.test.ts` and `src/utils/swarm/teammateModel.test.ts`.
- On 2026-04-25, `1F` was formally closed with the repo-wide typecheck requirement waived as pre-existing repo debt outside the scoped descriptor-migration work on `cheeky-cooking-moon`.
- Follow-up review on 2026-04-26 identified additive onboarding gaps around
  loader wiring and preset/UI metadata. Those gaps were closed later the same
  day by the Phase 3E generated-artifact pass.

---

## Phase 1 Merge Checkpoints

- [x] **1A merged** — registry skeleton + tests checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **1B+1C merged** — descriptor inventory + brand/model index checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **1D merged** — config compatibility checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **1E merged** — CLI/usage checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **1F complete** — targeted verification is green and the repo-wide typecheck item is explicitly waived as pre-existing debt

---

## Phase 2: Runtime Metadata Adoption

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

**Goal**: Move decision-making logic onto descriptors so runtime surfaces stop duplicating provider rules.

### Phase 2 Exit Criteria

- [x] Validation, discovery hints, preset metadata, and runtime affordances are descriptor-backed
- [x] UI and command surfaces read shared metadata instead of bespoke switches

### Phase 2 Entry Blockers

- [x] Phase 1F is completed, or the repo-wide `tsc --noEmit` baseline is explicitly accepted as pre-existing debt
- [x] Phase 1 merge checkpoints are confirmed in branch order on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] Phase 1 exit criteria are reconciled with current behavior before Phase 2 consumer migrations begin

Notes:
- Once the entry blockers clear, start `2A` and `2A.5` first; they are the planned front door for Phase 2 work.
- `2B` depends on `2A.5`, `2C` depends on `2A.5`, `2D` should coordinate with `2A` and `2B`, and `2E` stays last.
- `2A` was completed on-branch on 2026-04-25 by explicit user direction before the broader entry blockers were formally reconciled; keep that sequencing note visible while the remaining Phase 2 packets stay gated behind stable follow-on prerequisites.
- Reconciled during the 2026-04-25 tracker/code review pass:
  - repo-wide `bun run typecheck` was re-run and the remaining failures were explicitly accepted as broader pre-existing repo debt rather than Phase 1/2 regressions
  - Phase 1 checkpoints were confirmed on-branch in commit order (`d557c6b`, `0d0c437`, `9c02a21`, `4f3411b`, `cff7bfa`, `9f5fd87`, `b332b3f`)
  - Phase 1 exit criteria were checked against the live branch state and marked accordingly

### Phase 2 Recommended Sequence

- [x] Migrate read-only metadata consumers first
- [x] Migrate env/routing helpers second
- [x] Retire duplicated logic only after parity is verified

---

## Phase 2A: Validation Metadata Migration

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Inventory current validation rules by provider
- [x] Classify which rules are pure metadata and which are true runtime logic
- [x] Move metadata-like rules into descriptors
- [x] Keep truly procedural rules in helper functions where needed
- [x] Route validation entry points through descriptor-backed metadata

Notes:
- First work to start after the Phase 2 entry blockers clear.
- Keep a short migration note listing which validation rules stay procedural so later cleanup does not try to over-normalize them.
- Inventory/classification result: descriptor-backed targets can cover OpenAI, Gemini, GitHub, Mistral, MiniMax, and Bankr validation selection; Codex transport validation and GitHub token inspection remain procedural.
- Implementation in branch: `ValidationMetadata` now includes routing hints, vendor/gateway descriptors declare their own validation-selection metadata, and `src/utils/providerValidation.ts` now resolves validation targets from descriptor metadata instead of a hardcoded provider-id list.
- Procedural rules intentionally kept in helpers: Codex auth depends on transport resolution plus auth/account state, and GitHub token inspection still needs runtime token parsing/expiry checks after descriptor target selection.
- Focused verification on 2026-04-25 is green:
  - `bun test src/utils/providerValidation.test.ts src/utils/providerProfile.test.ts`
  - `bun test src/utils/providerProfiles.test.ts src/integrations/registry.test.ts src/integrations/index.test.ts`
  - filtered `bun run typecheck` for the touched Phase 2A files returned clean output
- Additional 2A regression coverage now verifies descriptor-driven precedence for Mistral vs stale OpenAI mode, GitHub vs OpenAI mode, and fallback validation for generic OpenAI-compatible routes such as Moonshot.

---

## Phase 2A.5: Discovery Cache Service

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Create `src/integrations/discoveryCache.ts`
- [x] Create `src/integrations/discoveryCache.test.ts`
- [x] Implement `parseDurationString` with `m`, `h`, `d` support and raw numbers
- [x] Implement `getCachedModels`, `setCachedModels`, `isCacheStale`
- [x] Implement `recordDiscoveryError` with stale-data preservation
- [x] Implement `clearDiscoveryCache` (per-route and all-routes)
- [x] Implement atomic writes (temp + rename)
- [x] Implement in-memory locking for concurrent access
- [x] Implement schema version + migration stub
- [x] Implement corruption fallback (empty cache, no crash)
- [x] Verify parse and TTL behavior in unit tests
- [x] Verify atomic write does not corrupt existing cache on crash mid-write
- [x] Verify concurrent writes are serialized
- [x] Verify `recordDiscoveryError` preserves stale cache data

Notes:
- This can begin alongside `2A` once Phase 2 entry blockers clear.
- `2B` and `2C` should not start wiring discovery caching until this packet is complete enough to provide stable helper APIs.
- Landed in branch: `src/integrations/discoveryCache.ts` stores per-route model discovery entries under `model-discovery-cache.json` in the Claude config home, with atomic temp-file writes, versioned schema loading, corruption fallback, and a serialized in-memory write lock.
- Current helper behavior: `getCachedModels(routeId, ttlMs)` stays fresh-by-default, and `getCachedModels(routeId, ttlMs, { includeStale: true })` exposes preserved stale entries or error-only entries so later `/model` consumers can surface fallback data and refresh failures together.
- Focused verification on 2026-04-25 is green:
  - `bun test src/integrations/discoveryCache.test.ts`
  - filtered `bun run typecheck` for `src/integrations/discoveryCache*.ts` returned clean output
- Follow-up hardening on 2026-04-25:
  - MiniMax validation routing now recognizes both `api.minimax.io` and `api.minimax.chat`
  - stale discovery cache entries are readable through the public helper API when callers opt in with `includeStale: true`

---

## Phase 2B: Discovery and Readiness Metadata Migration

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Map current readiness flows for Ollama, Atomic Chat, and other local/openai-compatible providers
- [x] Define which probe behaviors can be declared as metadata
- [x] Keep actual probe execution in code, but drive probe selection from descriptors
- [x] Add a model discovery service that can run declarative `catalog.discovery` configs
- [x] Consume `discoveryCache.ts` in the discovery service
- [x] Wire `setCachedModels` / `getCachedModels` into declarative `catalog.discovery` execution
- [x] Implement deterministic hybrid merge behavior where curated descriptor entries override discovered metadata
- [x] Implement built-in `discovery.kind: 'openai-compatible'` support for standard `/v1/models` discovery
- [x] Ensure OpenAI-compatible discovery uses the route's base URL and descriptor/profile-resolved headers automatically
- [x] Reserve custom discovery functions for non-standard response shapes only
- [x] Verify local provider labels still render correctly
- [x] Verify readiness messages still render correctly

Notes:
- `2A` and `2A.5` are complete, so this packet is now active on-branch.
- Completed 2B work in branch:
  - `StartupMetadata.probeReadiness` is now a typed descriptor field (`ReadinessProbeKind`) instead of a free-form string.
  - `ollama`, `atomic-chat`, `lmstudio`, and `openrouter` descriptors now declare readiness/discovery metadata directly.
  - `src/integrations/discoveryService.ts` now runs descriptor-backed discovery, caches results through `discoveryCache.ts`, preserves stale fallback, and merges curated hybrid entries ahead of discovered duplicates.
  - `src/utils/providerDiscovery.ts` now exports `probeOllamaModelCatalog()` so the service can distinguish unreachable Ollama from reachable-but-empty Ollama catalogs.
  - `src/components/ProviderManager.tsx` and `src/commands/provider/provider.tsx` now call `probeRouteReadiness()` instead of reaching directly into provider-specific probe helpers.
  - `src/services/api/bootstrap.ts` now uses `discoverModelsForRoute()` for recognized descriptor-backed local routes and falls back to the legacy generic `/models` fetch for custom local endpoints.
  - `resolveDiscoveryRouteIdFromBaseUrl()` now maps known descriptor routes by default base URL and local-route heuristics so bootstrap can share the cached discovery path with runtime callers.
- Focused verification completed on 2026-04-25:
  - `bun test src/integrations/discoveryService.test.ts`
  - `bun test src/components/ProviderManager.test.tsx`
  - `bun test src/commands/provider/provider.test.tsx`
  - `bun test src/utils/providerDiscovery.test.ts src/integrations/registry.test.ts src/integrations/index.test.ts`
  - filtered `bun run typecheck` for `src/integrations/discoveryService.ts`, `src/integrations/discoveryService.test.ts`, `src/components/ProviderManager.tsx`, `src/components/ProviderManager.test.tsx`, `src/commands/provider/provider.tsx`, `src/services/api/bootstrap.ts`, and `src/utils/providerProfile.ts` returned `FILTER_CLEAN`
- Verification note:
  - the focused `/provider` verification surfaced an env-precedence regression in `applySavedProfileToCurrentSession()`; fixing it keeps explicit provider env selections authoritative while saved-profile activation is attempted.

---

## Phase 2C: Provider UI Metadata Migration

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Replace hardcoded preset labels/defaults with descriptor lookups
- [x] Drive auth/setup prompts from descriptor metadata
- [x] Wire custom-header capability flags into the custom-provider flow
- [x] Make `/model` read active route catalog entries instead of global model availability
- [x] Call `getCachedModels` before rendering `/model` for dynamic/hybrid routes so cached discovered models appear immediately
- [x] Call `isCacheStale` to trigger background refresh when picker opens
- [x] Add `/model refresh` command to force model discovery refresh for the active route
- [x] Add an in-picker refresh action for model discovery, such as pressing `r`
- [x] Call `clearDiscoveryCache(routeId)` from `/model refresh` and in-picker refresh handlers
- [x] Show non-blocking refresh states: loading, success, failure with stale cache, and no changes found
- [x] Surface `entry.error` in the picker UI when refresh failed but stale data exists
- [x] Keep any UX-only branching that is truly presentational
- [x] Verify the `/provider` experience remains understandable after metadata migration

Notes:
- Unblock after `2A.5` and the first round of `2B` discovery/readiness helpers are stable enough for UI consumers.
- Work this packet in two slices: descriptor-backed provider labels/setup first, then `/model` cache/refresh UX second.
- Active work resumed on 2026-04-25. First slice is migrating preset labels/defaults/setup copy onto descriptor metadata before rewiring `/model` to the discovery cache service.
- Focused Phase 2C verification resumed on 2026-04-25 18:24 after isolating a combined-run Bun mock leak from `src/commands/model/model.test.tsx`; the `/model` tests now rely on the real OpenRouter descriptor route metadata so `/provider` summary tests keep seeing the real OpenAI and Gemini labels during the shared targeted run.
- Phase 2C was completed on 2026-04-25 18:30 after the shared targeted suite, focused `/provider` and `/model` test reruns, filtered typecheck pass for the touched Phase 2C files, and regression checks for `src/integrations/discoveryCache.test.ts` plus `src/utils/providerValidation.test.ts`.

---

## Phase 2D: Runtime Provider Detection Alignment

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Define the boundary between `APIProvider` and descriptor ids
- [x] Decide which legacy runtime provider names stay externally visible
- [x] Map descriptor-backed state onto `getAPIProvider()` without breaking existing callers
- [x] Inventory current `openaiShim.ts` provider/base-url conditionals and classify which can become descriptor metadata
- [x] Preserve DeepSeek/Moonshot `reasoning_content` replay behavior from PR #895 if it has landed
- [x] If PR #895 has not landed, explicitly test whether the migration still covers its reported DeepSeek thinking-mode edge cases
- [x] Preserve Z.AI GLM Coding Plan behavior from PR #896 if it has landed
- [x] Move Z.AI-style `max_tokens`, `store` stripping, thinking request format, and `reasoning_content` gates into descriptor metadata where possible
- [x] Avoid assuming DeepSeek-like reasoning behavior only applies to direct DeepSeek URLs; gateways may expose models with the same requirement
- [x] Document exceptions such as `github`, `bedrock`, `vertex`, and `mistral`
- [x] Verify existing callers still receive expected provider categories

Notes:
- Unblock after `2A` and `2B` establish the descriptor-backed metadata that runtime detection will consume.
- Before starting, check whether PR `#895` or PR `#896` landed so this packet preserves the right transport quirks instead of duplicating stale assumptions.
- Active work resumed on 2026-04-25 18:41. The first implementation slice is aligning `getAPIProvider()` with descriptor-backed active-route resolution while preserving the legacy externally visible provider categories that existing callers still expect.
- Current runtime-migration target: move OpenAI-shim request shaping for `reasoning_content`, `max_tokens`, and `store` onto route/model transport metadata where possible, while keeping explicit procedural fallbacks only for cases that cannot yet be expressed by the current descriptor inventory.
- Completed on 2026-04-25 18:53:
  - `src/utils/model/providers.ts` now maps descriptor-backed active routes onto the legacy `APIProvider` categories, with explicit compatibility fallbacks kept only for `foundry`, env-only `NVIDIA_NIM`, and env-only MiniMax recovery.
  - `src/integrations/runtimeMetadata.ts` now centralizes runtime route/shim metadata resolution, merges route/model OpenAI-shim overrides, and exposes an Anthropic-native transport check used by resume handling.
  - direct DeepSeek, Moonshot, Kimi Code, Gemini, GitHub, Mistral, and local route quirks now come from descriptor-backed OpenAI-shim metadata instead of hand-coded base-url/provider conditionals in `openaiShim.ts`.
  - gateway-routed DeepSeek models now inherit the same reasoning-content, `max_tokens`, and `store` behavior without relying on direct DeepSeek base URLs.
  - GitHub Claude native transport is now treated as Anthropic-native during conversation recovery so thinking blocks are preserved for that path.
- Exception notes:
  - `github`, `mistral`, `bedrock`, and `vertex` remain explicit runtime exception categories because existing callers still consume those legacy provider names directly.
  - PR `#896` / Z.AI still has not landed in this branch, so the Z.AI-specific preservation check completed as a no-op audit rather than a code migration.
- Focused verification on 2026-04-25 is green:
  - `bun test src/utils/model/providers.test.ts src/utils/providerProfiles.test.ts src/utils/conversationRecovery.test.ts`
  - `bun test src/services/api/openaiShim.test.ts`
- Filtered `bun run typecheck` for the new runtime-metadata file is clean; broader filtered output still includes pre-existing noise in `src/services/api/openaiShim.test.ts` and `src/utils/conversationRecovery.ts`, which predates this packet.

---

## Phase 2E: Phase-2 Verification and Drift Audit

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Run `/provider` flows for representative providers
- [x] Verify validation errors still appear at the right times
- [x] Verify local discovery still works
- [x] Audit remaining switch statements
- [x] Document whether each remaining switch is intentional or stale

Notes:
- Unblock only after `2A` through `2D` are complete enough to audit as one behavior slice.
- Treat this packet as the gate before any Phase 3 cleanup work starts.
- Active work resumed on 2026-04-25 18:59. Focused representative-provider verification is running across `/provider`, `/model`, validation, discovery, runtime detection, and resume/shim coverage before the remaining switch inventory is classified.
- Completed on 2026-04-25 19:09:
  - added representative `/provider` verification for descriptor-backed OpenRouter labeling plus Gemini and Mistral current-provider summaries in `src/commands/provider/provider.test.tsx`
  - added first-run Atomic Chat picker coverage in `src/components/ProviderManager.test.tsx` to confirm local discovery-backed provider setup still works
  - recorded the remaining switch inventory and classification in `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md`
- Follow-up hardening on 2026-04-25 19:18:
  - expanded `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md` to include the remaining intentional non-switch provider branches in `routeMetadata.ts`, `openaiShim.ts`, `provider.tsx`, and `conversationRecovery.ts`
  - replaced stale saved-profile picker wording in `src/components/ProviderManager.tsx` with the descriptor-backed route provider-type label and added focused regression coverage
- Review follow-up on 2026-04-25 20:01:
  - fixed skipped provider-category follow-through in `src/utils/status.tsx` so Status now covers `nvidia-nim` and `minimax`
  - fixed Mistral teammate fallback coverage in `src/utils/swarm/teammateModel.ts` by adding `mistral` entries to the shared model config table
  - filled out third-party provider placeholders in `src/utils/model/deprecation.ts` and added focused tests for the new status/teammate behavior
  - clarified that `src/utils/model/configs.ts` remains a transitional compatibility table for legacy `APIProvider` callers during Phase 2; replacing or consolidating that table belongs to later Phase 3 cleanup work once descriptor-backed callers fully take over
- Focused Phase 2E verification on 2026-04-25 is green:
  - `bun test src/components/ProviderManager.test.tsx src/commands/provider/provider.test.tsx src/utils/providerValidation.test.ts src/integrations/discoveryService.test.ts src/commands/model/model.test.tsx`
  - `bun test src/utils/providerDiscovery.test.ts src/utils/model/providers.test.ts src/services/api/openaiShim.test.ts src/utils/conversationRecovery.test.ts`
  - `bun test src/utils/status.test.ts src/utils/swarm/teammateModel.test.ts src/utils/model/providers.test.ts src/components/ProviderManager.test.tsx src/commands/provider/provider.test.tsx`
- Filtered `bun run typecheck` for the audited runtime/provider files still reports the same pre-existing baseline noise in `src/services/api/openaiShim.ts` and `src/utils/conversationRecovery.ts`; no new 2E-specific typecheck failures were introduced by this packet.

---

## Phase 2 Merge Checkpoints

- [x] **2A merged** — validation metadata checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **2A.5 merged** — discovery cache service checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **2B merged** — discovery/readiness metadata checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **2C merged** — provider UI metadata checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **2D merged** — runtime provider detection checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] **2E complete** — drift audit is green and Phase 3 can begin

---

## Phase 3: Cleanup

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

**Goal**: Remove transitional duplication once descriptor-backed behavior is trusted.

### Phase 3 Exit Criteria

- [x] Obsolete switch chains are removed
- [x] Compatibility shims are minimized and clearly named
- [x] Remaining exceptions are intentional and documented

### Phase 3 Entry Blockers

- [x] Phase 2 is complete on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] Phase 2E drift audit is recorded in `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md`
- [x] Repo-wide `bun run typecheck` baseline debt remains accepted as pre-existing debt during Phase 3; no cleanup packet in this branch carved off that broader debt separately

Notes:
- Phase 3 starts from the completed Phase 2 drift audit, not from the original migration assumptions.
- Phase 3 planning was re-reviewed against `plan/cheeky-cooking-moon.md` on 2026-04-25 20:24 so the tracker sections below mirror the master-plan packet order, dependencies, and cleanup boundaries.
- Active work resumed on 2026-04-25 20:39 with the first `3A` pass focused on removing duplicated provider-label/default branches from metadata-only surfaces before touching any compatibility or env-shaping bridges.
- `src/utils/model/configs.ts` is currently a compatibility bridge for legacy `APIProvider` callers such as teammate fallback; Phase 3 is where we decide whether to keep, rename, or retire that bridge.
- Provider surfaces already identified as transitional or likely Phase 3 cleanup candidates include:
  - legacy `APIProvider` compatibility mapping in `src/utils/model/providers.ts`
  - compatibility tables in `src/utils/model/configs.ts`
  - duplicated provider/env shaping spread across `src/utils/providerProfiles.ts`, `src/utils/providerProfile.ts`, and startup/runtime helpers
  - remaining explicit provider branches recorded in `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md`
- With the repo-wide typecheck-debt decision now recorded, the Phase 3 packets stayed tightly scoped and did not treat unrelated baseline `bun run typecheck` noise as proof that the cleanup work itself was blocked.
- Decision recorded after the completed `3D` audit: repo-wide `bun run typecheck` failures remain broader pre-existing repo debt, so Phase 3 closed without expanding scope to resolve unrelated baseline errors.

### Phase 3 Recommended Sequence

- [x] Remove dead metadata switches first
- [x] Consolidate overlapping type/name surfaces second
- [x] Consolidate env-shaping/runtime bridges third
- [x] Finish with one more audit and documentation pass

Notes:
- Keep these as separate branch-local checkpoints on `cheeky-cooking-moon`; Phase 3 cleanup should not be bundled into one large mixed packet.
- If a candidate removal or rename depends on proving runtime parity first, defer it to the later packet instead of forcing it into `3A`.

---

## Phase 3A: Dead Switch Removal

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Identify every switch made redundant by descriptors
- [x] Remove only the switches proven obsolete by tests
- [x] Keep a short migration note in commit/PR text for anything user-visible

### Current Slice Checklist

- [x] Audit the first metadata-only cleanup slice against `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md`
- [x] Remove duplicated OpenAI-compatible status-display branches in `src/utils/status.tsx`
- [x] Add focused regression coverage for the shared status-display path
- [x] Review `/provider` summary helpers for the next safe 3A cleanup slice
- [x] Remove the pure transport-kind label switch in `src/integrations/routeMetadata.ts`
- [x] Remove the pure provider-label switch in `src/components/CostThresholdDialog.tsx`
- [x] Add focused regression coverage for route-metadata and cost-threshold label paths
- [x] Decide which remaining candidates stay in `3A` versus move to `3B` or `3C`

Notes:
- Start from the inventory already captured in `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md`.
- Dependency from the master plan is already satisfied here because Phase 2 is complete on `cheeky-cooking-moon`.
- Candidate removals should exclude switches already classified as intentional compatibility bridges, transport executors, or UI state machines.
- Expected early-review candidates include older provider-label/default branches that are now fully descriptor-backed.
- Current slice: collapse duplicated OpenAI-compatible provider display branches in `src/utils/status.tsx` first, then decide whether the same treatment is safe for any `/provider` summary helpers without crossing into env-contract cleanup.
- Completed initial `3A` cleanup slice on 2026-04-25 20:46:
  - collapsed duplicated OpenAI-compatible status-display branches in `src/utils/status.tsx` behind shared provider metadata for `openai`, `codex`, `nvidia-nim`, and `minimax`
  - kept Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry, Gemini, and Mistral handling unchanged because those still rely on distinct env contracts or cloud/runtime details
  - added focused Codex status regression coverage in `src/utils/status.test.ts`
  - focused verification is green:
    - `bun test src/utils/status.test.ts src/utils/swarm/teammateModel.test.ts src/utils/model/providers.test.ts`
    - filtered `bun run typecheck` for `src/utils/status.tsx` and `src/utils/status.test.ts` returned `FILTER_CLEAN`
- Completed follow-up `3A` sweep on 2026-04-25 20:58:
  - reviewed `/provider` summary helpers and kept them out of `3A` because their remaining branches still reflect distinct saved-profile/env contracts rather than dead descriptor metadata
  - replaced the pure transport-kind label switch in `src/integrations/routeMetadata.ts` with shared transport-kind label metadata and added `src/integrations/routeMetadata.test.ts`
  - replaced the pure provider-label switch in `src/components/CostThresholdDialog.tsx` with a shared provider-label map and added `src/components/CostThresholdDialog.test.ts`
  - re-swept the remaining obvious branch sites; the switches left in `discoveryService.ts`, `providerValidation.ts`, `provider.tsx`, and `model/providers.ts` remain classified as runtime executors, compatibility bridges, or env-contract handlers and therefore move to later packets instead of staying in `3A`
  - focused verification is green:
    - `bun test src/integrations/routeMetadata.test.ts src/utils/status.test.ts src/components/CostThresholdDialog.test.ts src/utils/model/providers.test.ts`
    - filtered `bun run typecheck` for the touched `routeMetadata`, `status`, and `CostThresholdDialog` files returned `FILTER_CLEAN`
- `3A` migration note / checkpoint landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon` in commit `df8f232` (`refactor: start phase 3a dead-switch cleanup`), so the remaining `3A` work is closed and the next active packet is `3B`.

---

## Phase 3B: Type and Naming Consolidation

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Decide which legacy names remain public API
- [x] Keep compatibility aliases where callers still rely on them
- [x] Rename internal helpers where descriptor terminology is clearer

### Current Slice Checklist

- [x] Keep `APIProvider` as the public compatibility surface for existing callers
- [x] Introduce explicit `legacy` / `compatibility` names for bridge types and tables
- [x] Rename provider-profile compatibility helper names so env-shaping bridges read like bridges
- [x] Verify the naming-only pass does not change provider/profile behavior

Notes:
- This packet is the place to make the long-term naming decision after Phase 2D, but it should stay behavior-light wherever possible.
- This packet should explicitly decide the long-term role of `APIProvider` versus descriptor route ids.
- `src/utils/model/configs.ts` and similar provider-keyed tables should either be renamed as explicit compatibility bridges or moved behind clearer descriptor-era helpers.
- Any consolidation here must preserve the external caller contracts that still intentionally consume legacy provider categories.
- Keep saved-profile formats, env var names, and user-facing route/provider wording stable unless a later packet explicitly migrates them.
- Active work resumed on 2026-04-25 21:11 with a first naming-only pass over `src/utils/model/providers.ts`, `src/utils/model/configs.ts`, `src/utils/model/modelStrings.ts`, `src/utils/model/deprecation.ts`, and `src/utils/providerProfiles.ts`.
- Current target for this pass:
  - keep `APIProvider` as the public compatibility surface for existing callers
  - introduce clearer internal `legacy` / `compatibility` names for bridge types and tables
  - rename provider-profile runtime helper names so env-shaping bridges read like bridges instead of descriptor-native routing
- Completed on 2026-04-25 21:19:
  - kept `APIProvider` as the backward-compatible public name, but introduced `LegacyAPIProvider` in `src/utils/model/providers.ts` so the bridge surface is named explicitly where internal callers want that clarity
  - renamed the provider-keyed compatibility table surface in `src/utils/model/configs.ts` to `LegacyProviderModelConfig` / `LEGACY_PROVIDER_MODEL_CONFIGS`, while preserving `ModelConfig` and `ALL_MODEL_CONFIGS` as compatibility aliases for older imports
  - updated `src/utils/model/modelStrings.ts` and `src/utils/model/deprecation.ts` to use the clearer legacy compatibility names internally
  - renamed `resolveProfileRuntime()` / `ProfileRuntimeMode` to `resolveProfileCompatibility()` / `ProfileCompatibilityMode` in `src/utils/providerProfiles.ts` so the env-shaping bridge reads as compatibility logic rather than descriptor-native routing
  - focused verification is green:
    - `bun test src/utils/model/providers.test.ts src/utils/providerProfiles.test.ts src/utils/swarm/teammateModel.test.ts src/utils/status.test.ts`
    - filtered `bun run typecheck` for the touched provider/config/modelStrings/deprecation/providerProfiles files returned `FILTER_CLEAN`

---

## Phase 3C: Env-Shaping Consolidation

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Compare `providerProfiles.ts`, `providerProfile.ts`, and startup env builders
- [x] Centralize the parts that can now be safely descriptor-driven
- [x] Replace eligible `openaiShim.ts` base URL/provider conditionals with descriptor-backed transport config
- [x] Keep `reasoning_content` preservation behavior intact for routes that require it
- [x] Add or retain regression coverage for assistant messages with thinking blocks, no thinking blocks, string content, tool calls, and synthetic interrupt messages
- [x] Preserve special-case behavior where transport contracts still differ

Notes:
- Phase 2D and 2E intentionally left some env shaping in place for compatibility; this is the cleanup packet that can reduce that duplication.
- Dependency from the master plan is already satisfied here because Phase 2 is complete, but this packet should still remain isolated from pure naming cleanup where possible.
- The known intentional exceptions from Phase 2E (`github`, `mistral`, `bedrock`, `vertex`, `foundry`, env-only MiniMax fallback, env-only NVIDIA NIM fallback) must be re-evaluated carefully rather than flattened by default.
- `openaiShim.ts` should only lose branches that are already provably covered by descriptor/runtime metadata.
- Keep the `reasoning_content` regression list above attached to this packet as a hard gate, not as optional follow-up.
- Active work resumed on 2026-04-25 21:08 with the first `3C` packet focused on consolidating shared compatibility env shaping between `providerProfile.ts`, `providerProfiles.ts`, and the eligible `openaiShim.ts` OpenAI-env projection path without flattening the known exception routes.
- Completed on 2026-04-25 21:32 by introducing a shared managed-env clear/apply path in `src/utils/providerProfile.ts`, switching `buildLaunchEnv()` and `applyProviderProfileToProcessEnv()` onto that shared compatibility shaper, and reducing `createOpenAIShimClient()` to the remaining credential aliasing that `resolveProviderRequest()` does not already cover.
- The `3C` packet intentionally preserved the known exception routes instead of flattening them: `github`, `mistral`, `bedrock`, `vertex`, env-only Bankr aliasing, env-only MiniMax fallback detection, and the NVIDIA NIM mode bit now remain explicit where transport/auth contracts still differ.
- Targeted verification is green:
  - `bun test src/utils/providerProfile.test.ts src/utils/providerProfiles.test.ts src/services/api/openaiShim.test.ts`
  - filtered `bun run typecheck` output no longer reports new errors in `src/utils/providerProfile.ts` or `src/utils/providerProfiles.ts`; the remaining hits in `src/services/api/openaiShim.ts` are pre-existing repo baseline noise that was already present before this packet.

---

## Phase 3D: Final Audit and Documentation Pass

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Inventory all provider-specific special cases still left in the repo
- [x] Classify them as intentional, temporary, or missed migration work
- [x] Update the architecture note with final constraints and known exceptions

Notes:
- This packet should build directly on the earlier `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md` inventory rather than restarting the audit from scratch.
- Dependency from the master plan is `3A` through `3C`; do not mark this complete until those packets land or are explicitly waived.
- The expected output is a tighter final exception list plus plan/docs updates that clearly distinguish intentional long-term exceptions from temporary cleanup leftovers.
- Active work resumed on 2026-04-25 21:51 with a focused audit of the remaining provider-specific runtime branches after the Phase 3C commit, using `plan/phase-2e-drift-audit.md` as the starting inventory instead of reopening already-closed metadata cleanup.
- Completed on 2026-04-25 22:02 with two branch-local artifacts:
  - `plan/phase-3d-final-audit.md` — final inventory/classification of remaining provider-specific runtime branches
  - `docs/architecture/integrations.md` — architecture note describing the descriptor-first system, the temporary compatibility bridges, and the intentional long-term runtime exceptions
- The audit did not surface new missed runtime migration hotspots that needed Phase 3 code changes; the remaining items all fit into either intentional protocol differences or temporary env/config compatibility bridges.

---

## Phase 3E: Descriptor-Native Onboarding Closure

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Choose and implement the sustainable loader strategy: constrained descriptor-folder discovery or generated loader artifacts
- [x] Remove the need to hand-edit `src/integrations/index.ts` for normal descriptor-backed routes
- [x] Define descriptor-owned preset metadata for routes that should appear in preset-driven `/provider` flows
- [x] Derive `routeForPreset()` and related compatibility helpers from descriptor-authored preset metadata or a generated manifest derived from it
- [x] Derive provider preset ordering, descriptions, display labels/names, and env-var override metadata from the same descriptor-authored source
- [x] Eliminate or generate any separate handwritten preset-id union so preset typing cannot drift from descriptor reality
- [x] Add validation for duplicate preset ids, incomplete preset metadata, and descriptor routes that opt into presets without sufficient UI/config data
- [x] Add tests that prove a representative preset-participating gateway can be added with descriptor file changes only, or descriptor file changes plus regeneration of derived artifacts, with no hand-edits to unrelated consumer tables
- [x] Add equivalent tests for a representative direct model-serving vendor
- [x] Keep an explicit opt-out path for descriptor routes that should not appear as presets

Notes:
- Added on 2026-04-26 after follow-up review confirmed the remaining additive-onboarding gap is structural, not just documentation wording.
- Completed on 2026-04-26 with a generated-artifact workflow centered on `scripts/generate-integrations-artifacts.ts` and `src/integrations/generated/integrationArtifacts.generated.ts`.
- `src/integrations/index.ts`, `src/integrations/compatibility.ts`, `src/integrations/providerUiMetadata.ts`, and the preset-id type now derive from generated artifacts rather than separate handwritten tables.
- Preset participation is descriptor-owned via `preset` metadata, ordering is generated from preset descriptions with standard alphanumeric sorting, and `custom` is pinned last automatically.
- Focused verification is green for registry/compatibility/profile/provider flows, plus generator tests that prove representative gateway and direct-vendor onboarding works from descriptor changes plus regeneration only.
- Phase 4 gateway/vendor docs were cleaned up in the same pass so they no longer present manual loader/preset/UI edits as the normal workflow.

---

## Phase 3 Merge Checkpoints

- [x] **3A merged** — dead-switch cleanup landed in small safe packets
- [x] **3B merged** — type/naming consolidation landed separately from runtime behavior changes
- [x] **3C merged** — env-shaping consolidation landed after targeted regression tests
- [x] **3D complete** — final audit/doc pass is green and Phase 4 can begin
- [x] **3E complete** — additive onboarding is descriptor-native through generated artifacts and descriptor-owned preset metadata

Notes:
- As with the earlier checkpoints, "merged" here means landed on `cheeky-cooking-moon`, not merged out to another branch.

---

## Phase 4: Documentation and Reference Samples

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

**Goal**: Produce implementation-quality documentation for the descriptor system and give future contributors reliable reference examples for the most common integration patterns.

### Phase 4 Exit Criteria

- [x] Docs explain how to add each descriptor type
- [x] Docs include detailed worked samples for multiple gateway and vendor patterns
- [x] Docs explain when and how `/usage` should be attached to a vendor or gateway
- [x] Docs clearly call out the difference between metadata, routing, and transport behavior
- [x] All documentation lives under `/docs`
- [x] All documentation is written in `.md` format
- [x] Docs are organized into a clear, maintainable `/docs` structure

### Phase 4 Entry Blockers

- [x] Phase 3 is complete on `cheeky-cooking-moon`
- [x] `docs/architecture/integrations.md` exists from `3D` and can seed the architecture/terminology packet
- [x] Confirm the remaining Phase 4 doc structure and target file layout before authoring the new how-to/reference guides

Notes:
- This phase should mirror the master-plan packet order (`4A` through `4E`) rather than mixing glossary, how-to, `/usage`, and reference-sample work together.
- As with the earlier checkpoints, Phase 4 work stays branch-local on `cheeky-cooking-moon`; nothing in this tracker implies merging outside the branch.
- Treat the existing `docs/architecture/integrations.md` note as the seed artifact for `4A`, not as a reason to skip the remaining glossary, terminology, and docs-structure work.
- `4A` now defines the Phase 4 docs layout around `docs/architecture/` plus `docs/integrations/`, with future contributor guides living under `docs/integrations/how-to/`.

### Phase 4 Recommended Sequence

- [x] Document the architecture and terminology first
- [x] Document add-a-new-integration workflows second
- [x] Add worked reference samples third
- [x] Add `/usage` integration guidance and review docs for accuracy last

---

## Phase 4A: Documentation Structure and Terminology

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Ensure all new documentation lives under `/docs`
- [x] Ensure all documentation files are `.md`
- [x] Choose the target doc locations
- [x] Add a top-level architecture document for descriptors and registry behavior
- [x] Define standard terminology for vendor, gateway, model, brand, and anthropic proxy
- [x] Document the boundary between descriptor metadata and transport implementation
- [x] Document that `transportConfig.kind` is the routing contract for gateways
- [x] Document that gateway `category` is optional display/grouping metadata and must not drive runtime routing
- [x] Document the descriptor authoring pattern using `defineVendor`, `defineGateway`, `defineCatalog`, `defineModel`, `defineBrand`, and `defineAnthropicProxy`
- [x] Document that loader-owned registration means contributors should not call registry functions directly in normal descriptor files
- [x] Document the compatibility layer and legacy naming expectations

Notes:
- Seed artifact already present from `3D`: `docs/architecture/integrations.md`.
- Completed on 2026-04-25 by expanding `docs/architecture/integrations.md` and adding:
  - `docs/integrations/overview.md` — docs map, authoring rules, routing contract, loader-owned registration, and compatibility-layer guidance
  - `docs/integrations/glossary.md` — standard terminology for routes, vendors, gateways, brands, models, and anthropic proxies
- The chosen Phase 4 docs structure is:
  - `docs/architecture/` for architecture notes
  - `docs/integrations/` for overview/glossary/reference docs
  - `docs/integrations/how-to/` for contributor how-to guides in later packets

Suggested doc outputs:
- `docs/architecture/integrations.md`
- `docs/integrations/overview.md`
- `docs/integrations/glossary.md`

---

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Write a step-by-step guide for adding a new vendor
- [x] Write a step-by-step guide for adding a new gateway
- [x] Keep all vendor and gateway guides under `/docs` as Markdown files
- [x] Include a vendor example with direct OpenAI-compatible routing
- [x] Include a vendor example that acts as its own first-party model endpoint with a catalog, such as OpenAI or DeepSeek
- [x] Include a gateway example that is addable in one file
- [x] Include a gateway example that uses an optional `gateways/<id>.models.ts` companion file for a large manual catalog or discovery function
- [x] Ensure examples use `defineGateway` and `defineCatalog` rather than direct registry/type imports
- [x] Explicitly show default exports from descriptor files and catalog files
- [x] Explicitly avoid `registerGateway`, `registerVendor`, and direct `import type` boilerplate in contributor-facing examples
- [x] Show `transportConfig.kind: 'openai-compatible'` for hosted OpenAI-compatible gateways
- [x] Show `transportConfig.kind: 'local'` for local gateways such as Ollama or LM Studio
- [x] Show `transportConfig.kind: 'anthropic-proxy'` for Anthropic-compatible proxy gateways
- [x] Explain the difference between `max_tokens` and `max_completion_tokens` for OpenAI-compatible routes
- [x] Document when to set `openaiShim.maxTokensField: 'max_tokens'`
- [x] Document when to set `openaiShim.maxTokensField: 'max_completion_tokens'`
- [x] Include examples for strict OpenAI-compatible providers that reject the wrong max-token field, such as Z.AI-style routes
- [x] Explain `category: 'local' | 'hosted' | 'aggregating'` as optional grouping only
- [x] Include a gateway example that exposes only its own hosted models
- [x] Include a gateway example that hosts a mixed catalog of third-party brands/models
- [x] Include a gateway example with `catalog.source: 'dynamic'`
- [x] Include a gateway example with `catalog.source: 'hybrid'`
- [x] Include a gateway example with discovery implemented in `gateways/<id>.models.ts`, human-readable discovery cache TTL, refresh mode, and manual refresh enabled
- [x] Document `discoveryCacheTtl` with examples such as `30m`, `1h`, and `1d`
- [x] Document each `discoveryRefreshMode` option with when to use it
- [x] Include examples for `manual`, `on-open`, `background-if-stale`, and `startup`
- [x] Include a gateway example whose hosted models differ in reasoning/thinking support, context window, input limits, and output limits
- [x] Include a gateway example with required static custom headers
- [x] Include guidance for optional user-supplied custom headers
- [x] Avoid redundant gateway examples that use `targetVendorId` or `isOpenAICompatible`; use `transportConfig.kind` instead
- [x] Document how presets, compatibility mappings, and consumer surfaces should be updated

Suggested doc outputs:
- `docs/integrations/how-to/add-vendor.md`
- `docs/integrations/how-to/add-gateway.md`

Required sample patterns:
- vendor with standard API key auth
- vendor with custom static headers
- vendor that owns a first-party model catalog
- gateway addable in one file
- gateway addable in two files because it needs a large manual catalog or discovery function
- gateway with only first-party models
- gateway with mixed hosted models and `providerModelMap`
- gateway transport examples for `openai-compatible`, `local`, and `anthropic-proxy`
- gateway max-token-field examples for legacy/common `max_tokens` providers and newer OpenAI/Azure-style `max_completion_tokens` providers
- gateway with static catalog because discovery is unavailable
- gateway with hybrid catalog because discovery is incomplete
- gateway with dynamic discovery, stale cache fallback, `/model refresh`, and in-picker refresh
- gateway discovery TTL examples: `30m` for fast-changing catalogs, `1h` for moderately active providers, `1d` for stable hosted gateways
- gateway refresh-mode examples: `manual` for flaky/rate-limited providers, `on-open` for routes that need fresh lists, `background-if-stale` for most hosted gateways, `startup` for fast local providers
- gateway whose models differ in reasoning/thinking behavior and context/input/output limits
- gateway with custom header requirements
- gateway examples must not use removed fields such as `targetVendorId`, `isOpenAICompatible`, or routing-oriented gateway `classification`

Notes:
- Completed on 2026-04-25 by adding:
  - `docs/integrations/how-to/add-vendor.md` — vendor onboarding rules plus direct OpenAI-compatible, custom-static-header, and first-party-catalog examples
  - `docs/integrations/how-to/add-gateway.md` — one-file and two-file gateway patterns, transport-family examples, discovery-cache guidance, token-field guidance, and compatibility-surface follow-through
- The new gateway guide explicitly keeps `transportConfig.kind` as the routing contract and treats `category` as display/grouping metadata only.
- Follow-up review on 2026-04-26 initially kept the guide honest about branch-local manual follow-through, and the later Phase 3E pass removed that temporary debt by moving loader/preset/UI metadata onto generated descriptor artifacts.

---

## Phase 4C: "How To Add a Model" and "How To Add an Anthropic Proxy" Guides

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Write a step-by-step guide for adding a model descriptor
- [x] Keep all model and anthropic proxy guides under `/docs` as Markdown files
- [x] Ensure model and anthropic proxy examples use `defineModel` and `defineAnthropicProxy`
- [x] Explain that shared model descriptors act primarily as glossary/index metadata and optional route enrichment
- [x] Explain when to add a brand descriptor versus only a model descriptor
- [x] Document `providerModelMap` with concrete examples
- [x] Explain model lookup priority and fallback to `openaiContextWindows.ts`
- [x] Explain why adding a gateway or direct-vendor catalog should not normally require editing multiple shared model files
- [x] Write a step-by-step guide for adding an anthropic proxy descriptor
- [x] Document Anthropic-specific env var contracts and routing expectations
- [x] Explain how anthropic proxies differ from OpenAI-compatible gateways

Suggested doc outputs:
- `docs/integrations/how-to/add-model.md`
- `docs/integrations/how-to/add-anthropic-proxy.md`

Required sample patterns:
- model attached to a canonical vendor only
- model shared across multiple route catalogs using `providerModelMap`
- anthropic proxy using Anthropic-native auth and base URL configuration

Notes:
- Completed on 2026-04-25 by adding:
  - `docs/integrations/how-to/add-model.md` — shared model descriptor rules, brand-vs-model guidance, `providerModelMap`, and lookup/fallback guidance
  - `docs/integrations/how-to/add-anthropic-proxy.md` — anthropic-proxy authoring rules, `envVarConfig`, Anthropic-native env contracts, and transport-boundary guidance
- The model guide keeps route-owned catalogs as the source of truth for availability and treats shared model descriptors as glossary/index metadata plus optional route enrichment.

---

## Phase 4D: `/usage` Integration Guide for Vendors and Gateways

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Keep the `/usage` guide under `/docs` as a Markdown file
- [x] Document the `usage` field on vendor, gateway, and anthropic proxy descriptors
- [x] Explain when `/usage` belongs on the vendor descriptor
- [x] Explain when a gateway should delegate usage to a linked vendor
- [x] Explain when a gateway should define its own usage handling because it has its own usage API
- [x] Document required fetch/parse module structure for supported usage integrations
- [x] Document fallback behavior for unsupported providers
- [x] Include one worked vendor `/usage` example
- [x] Include one worked gateway `/usage` example
- [x] Include one worked unsupported-provider fallback example
- [x] Ensure `/usage` examples follow the `define*` authoring style and do not call registry functions directly

Suggested doc outputs:
- `docs/integrations/how-to/add-usage-support.md`

Required sample patterns:
- vendor with native usage API
- gateway that delegates usage behavior to a linked vendor
- gateway with its own usage API
- unsupported provider with neutral fallback behavior

Notes:
- Completed on 2026-04-25 by adding `docs/integrations/how-to/add-usage-support.md`.
- The guide documents the descriptor `usage` field, vendor-owned usage, gateway delegation, gateway-owned usage APIs, unsupported fallbacks, and the current implementation boundary where descriptor resolution is generic but concrete runtime/UI handlers still exist for Anthropic, MiniMax, and Codex.
- The guide now also calls out that anthropic-proxy descriptors can declare `usage` metadata as part of the shared schema contract, while the active `/usage` resolver in this branch still routes vendor/gateway targets plus the `firstParty` compatibility id.

---

## Phase 4E: Reference Sample Pack and Docs Review

**Status**: `COMPLETE`

- [x] Keep the sample pack and contributor notes under `/docs` as Markdown files
- [x] Gather the best sample snippets into one reference pack
- [x] Verify samples are internally consistent with descriptor interfaces
- [x] Verify samples use `define*` helpers and default exports rather than direct registry/type imports
- [x] Verify gateway samples use `transportConfig.kind` for routing and only use `category` for optional grouping
- [x] Verify no sample uses removed gateway fields such as `targetVendorId` or `isOpenAICompatible`
- [x] Verify samples explain `max_tokens` versus `max_completion_tokens` and use `openaiShim.maxTokensField` where needed
- [x] Verify samples use the correct repo paths and current command surfaces
- [x] Verify `/usage` examples reflect actual routing rules
- [x] Remove or mark any sample that is intentionally illustrative rather than copy-paste ready
- [x] Add a short "common pitfalls" section for contributors

Suggested doc outputs:
- `docs/integrations/reference-samples.md`
- `docs/integrations/common-pitfalls.md`

Notes:
- Completed on 2026-04-25 by adding:
  - `docs/integrations/reference-samples.md` — a curated sample pack covering direct vendors, first-party vendor catalogs, local gateways, hybrid two-file gateways, shared model descriptors, anthropic proxies, and current `/usage` metadata patterns
  - `docs/integrations/common-pitfalls.md` — a short pre-PR checklist for descriptor type choice, routing fields, discovery/catalog boundaries, max-token-field selection, `/usage` scope, and compatibility-layer follow-through
- The 4E docs review re-checked the current repo paths and command/runtime surfaces referenced across the Phase 4 docs set, including `define.ts`, `descriptors.ts`, `profileResolver.ts`, `routeMetadata.ts`, `runtimeMetadata.ts`, `providerUiMetadata.ts`, `discoveryCache.ts`, `discoveryService.ts`, `src/commands/usage/index.ts`, and `src/components/Settings/Usage.tsx`.
- Reference-pack samples are explicitly marked as illustrative where they are not meant to be copy-paste-ready production descriptors.
